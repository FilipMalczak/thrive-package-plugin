This will be filled. Right now I do the work, I'll write readme later

## ToDo

- finish the implementation (duh)
  - dependency on other subproject
  - core dependencies
  - facets
  - ... ?
  - REFACTOR!!!
- test it somehow
- provie CircleCI config

## Loose notes

Facet consists of (besides name) *main* service and other services. Other service named the same way
as main should be an error (**todo** check if its implemented).

Layout is set of facets - special one named
*core* and other, referred simply as facets.
